# COWS-BULLS
A game like Wordle where the letters of a secret word are to be guessed correctly. The Secret is a 5 letter word. The user can enter 10 guesses maximum. 
If a guess has the same letter(s) as the Secret but is not in the same position it is referred to as a bull.
If the letter and position both are correctly guessed it is called a cow. For each guess you need to print the number of cows(C) and bulls(B). 
The game ends when the user gets all 5 Cows.

Example Case:
